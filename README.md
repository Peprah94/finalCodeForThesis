This repository hosts all the Rsrcipts and results used for my PHD thesis with title
"A statistical Framework for modeling biodiversity data". The thesis contains 
seven papers and here are the codes for each:

-  Paper Three : Sequential Monte Carlo methods for data assimilation problems 
in ecology

- Paper Four : Using NIMBLE to implement Markov Chain Monte Carlo with Integrated 
Nested Laplace approximation

- Paper Five : Modeling heterogeneity in classification process in multi-species 
distribution models can improve predictive performance.

- Paper Six : Integrating data from different taxonomic resolutions to better estimate 
community alpha diversity

- Paper Seven : Modeling species distribution using data from different sources
and quality while accounting for uneven sampling effort, imperfect detection and
misclassification

- Appendix : The appendix contains tow subfolders which contains the source files
for the R-packages developed in this thesis.
